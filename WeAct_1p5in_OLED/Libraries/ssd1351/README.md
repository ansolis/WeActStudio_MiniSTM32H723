# SSD1351 OLED Display Library

This library is based on the code from the [stm32-ssd1351](https://github.com/afiskon/stm32-ssd1351/)
project by Alexander "R2AUK". In his [write-up](https://eax.me/stm32-ssd1351/) on this project,
Alexander says that he used [Adafruit's library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-SSD1351-library)
code for reference, so the license terms from both projects have been included in the current directory.
